                    Create a Room as a 'Landing Page' for your organization.<br>
                    <div class='pagetitle3'>
                        A room is like a blog page and is in a social media format. Room 
                        membership can be used to organize communities, streaming channels, 
                        and group chats.
                        
                        You can have different rooms for different groups inside your organization
                        but always have one that includes all members.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div class='pagetitle3 help_enterprise_room tapped2' style="color:steelblue;cursor:pointer">
                        More info about Rooms
                    </div>
                </li>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    Populate your Room with members<br>
                    <div class='pagetitle3'>
                    This can be done in two ways. First, you can send out a "Group Invite" link
                    so that your members can self-join. You will have better results 
                    if you do a group invite since the members can interact with you in 
                    a room and see the landing page. 
                    <br><br>
                    Second, you can 
                    import members to a specific room via a CSV file (comma delimited text file) containing email addresses and a default 
                    password. Members will be asked to change their password upon login.
                    <br><br>
                    Those who download the mobile app or use certain browsers get an enhanced and more engaging experience which includes instant push 
                    notifications so they can immediately be informed of new messages in the room.

                    <div class='pagetitle3 help_enterprise_invite' style="color:steelblue;cursor:pointer">

                    <div class='pagetitle3'>
                    Your rooms are landing pages. You can engage users in a more social media 
                    format and can have an expanded message than what can be sent using the limited 
                    SMS text. Create content with media (like photos and videos).
